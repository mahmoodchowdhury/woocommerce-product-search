WooCommerce Product Search
--------------------------

This little snippet will allow you to replace the default WordPress search with WooCommerce product search without needing any third party extension or plugin.

1) Make sure to place the query argument right after "get_header()" function within the template file.
2) Place the HTML form element as you please, and if needed change the "action" value from "/" to your website URL (e.g. example.com - don't forget to include https).

Feel free to modify the code as you please.

Happy coding :)
